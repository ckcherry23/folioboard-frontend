### Navigating the code

This is the main file structure

```
.
├── node_modules
├── public
├── src
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .prettierrc.js
└── yarn.lock
```

Main directories/files to note:

-   `src` usually includes all your source code. That is where most of your functional code will be.
-   `README.md` is a form of documentation about the project. It is what you are reading right now.
-   `package.json` contains important metadata, for example, the dependencies and available scripts in the project.
-   `.eslintrc.js` contains the configuration for ESLint. ESLint is a tool to help enforce code consistency.
-   `.prettierrc.js` contains the configuration for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help format code.

## Additional Notes

-   This project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
-   The linting and code formatting rules are specified in `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` respectively.
-   The available scripts are in `package.json`.
    To fix linting and formatting errors, run:
    -   `yarn lint:fix`
    -   `yarn format:fix`
